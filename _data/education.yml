    During my time at Algonquin, I learned the more practical use of software development. From a variety of courses including .Net Enterprise Application Development, Compilers, Numerical Computing, Data Structures, Operating System Fundamentals (Linux), Web Application Programming, Database, Networking Basics, C++, QNX Real time Programming.
    These courses have given me experience in a range of different technological aspects.
